kura assumes its environment drifts — extensions go missing, configs change,
indexes desync — and treats recovery as a feature: diagnose with
`kura doctor`, repair with `kura doctor --fix`, and keep the knowledge base
healthy over time with link auto-resolution, tag gardening, and staleness
detection. The standing principle (SPEC §10.4): **surface problems and prompt
review; never delete content automatically.**

## `kura doctor` — diagnostics

`src/cli/commands/doctor.ts` runs the checks below and prints one
`✓ / ⚠ / ✗` line each. Exit code is 1 if any check **fail**ed, 0 otherwise
(warnings don't fail the run). Provider probes use a 2 s timeout.

| Check | ok | warn | fail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `platform` | always — reports `platform-arch`, Bun version, `KURA_HOME` | — | — |
| `homebrew-sqlite` (macOS only) | dylib exists at the arch-specific path | — | missing → `brew install sqlite` |
| `config` | parsed, or absent (defaults apply) | — | `config.toml` fails to parse (checks continue on defaults) |
| `sqlite-vec` | loads into a probe `:memory:` DB and `vec_version()` answers | — | load failure |
| `vaporetto` | loads with entry point `sqlite3_vaporetto_init` **and** passes a live round-trip: index a Japanese sentence, match it via `vaporetto_or_query('全文検索')` | platform unsupported (trigram fallback), or not yet installed (`kura init` will download) | load error, or the tokenization round-trip misses |
| `database` | `PRAGMA quick_check` = ok — reports path, schema version, doc count, tokenizer | DB not created yet (`run 'kura init'`); also relays `openDatabase()` warnings | `quick_check` failure or the DB cannot be opened |
| `fts-sync` | (emitted only on mismatch) | `documents` vs `documents_fts` row counts differ → rebuild required | — |
| `fts-tokenizer` | (emitted only when relevant) | DB was built with trigram but vaporetto now works → reindex recommended | — |
| `embedding-model` | (emitted only on mismatch) | `meta.embedding_model` ≠ config → `kura embed --all` | — |
| `ollama` | `GET /api/tags` reachable (reports model count) | unreachable | — |
| `ollama-models` | embedding / reranker / generation models all installed (names compared case-insensitively, `:latest` stripped) | missing models, with ready-to-paste `ollama pull ...` hints | — |
| `lmstudio` | `GET /v1/models` reachable | unreachable | — |
| `llm-provider` | resolved provider (explicit config value, or auto: ollama → lmstudio) | `none` → degraded mode, keyword search only | — |

The vaporetto check deliberately exercises real tokenization rather than just
dlopen success, so a broken model embed shows up as `fail`, not a silent
search regression.

## `kura doctor --fix` — repairs

Fixes run **before** the diagnostic pass, so the printed report reflects the
repaired state. Order (from `runFixes`):

1. **vaporetto re-fetch** — if the platform is supported and the extension
   file is missing, `ensureVaporetto({ download: true })` re-downloads with
   SHA256 verification (see [native-extensions.md](native-extensions.md)).
   Failures are reported, not fatal.
2. **`vec-recreate`** (`recreateVecIfModelChanged`) — if
   `meta.embedding_model` / `meta.embedding_dimensions` disagree with config,
   drop and recreate `chunks_vec` with the new dimension count, set every
   `chunks.embedded_at = NULL`, and update meta. All vectors are invalidated,
   which is why this runs first — later steps then operate on the new table.
   The report tells the user to run `kura embed` to regenerate.
3. **`gc-orphans`** (`gcOrphans`) — delete `chunks` whose document is gone,
   then `chunks_vec` rows whose chunk is gone. Orphans are **counted with
   explicit `SELECT COUNT(*)` before deleting** because the `vec0` virtual
   table reports inaccurate `changes` counts — don't "simplify" this to
   `result.changes`.
4. **`content-hash`** (`fixContentHashes`) — recompute SHA256 for every
   document; on mismatch, route the row through `updateDocument()` with its
   own content and its **original `updated_at` preserved**. Going through the
   repository means the fix re-chunks and re-syncs FTS/links/tags in one
   transaction instead of just patching the hash column.
5. **`fts-rebuild`** (`rebuildFtsIfNeeded`) — if `documents_fts` and
   `documents` row counts differ, wipe FTS and re-insert every document with
   its synthesized `tags` column (space-joined tag paths).
6. **`resolve-links`** (`resolveAllUnresolvedLinks`) — re-runs the shared
   two-stage resolution (`resolveLinkTarget` in `src/core/links.ts`) for
   every `target_id IS NULL` link, **scoped to the source document's
   bucket**, case-insensitive, self-links excluded: full-path spellings
   resolve exactly; a short-form title resolves only when exactly one
   candidate exists — **ambiguous short forms are skipped, not
   force-resolved** (they stay visible in `kura link broken`).
7. **`fts-retokenize`** (`retokenizeFts`) — only when the DB tokenizer is
   `trigram` but vaporetto loaded in this process: drop `documents_fts`,
   recreate it with `tokenize='vaporetto'`, re-insert all rows, and update
   `meta.fts_tokenizer`. This is the trigram → vaporetto upgrade path
   (e.g. a DB initialized with `--no-download`).

Each helper in `src/core/doctor.ts` is idempotent and returns `null` when
there is nothing to do; `--fix` prints `fixed: <action> <detail>` per applied
repair or `--fix: nothing to repair`.

## Link self-healing

Wiki-link health is maintained continuously, not just by doctor
(SPEC §10.1; implementation in `src/core/links.ts` and
`src/core/documents.ts`):

- **Write-first linking.** Saving a document records every `[[title]]` /
  `[[full/path/Title]]` in `links`, resolving targets through the shared
  two-stage resolution (`resolveLinkTarget`: full path first, then
  title-only-when-exactly-one-candidate; same bucket, case-insensitive —
  see [document-notation.md](document-notation.md)); non-matches **and
  ambiguous short forms** are stored with `target_id = NULL` (unresolved),
  not dropped or force-resolved.
- **Auto-resolution on create/rename/move.** `createDocument` and any
  title/path/bucket-changing `updateDocument` call `resolveUnresolvedLinks`,
  which rewires unresolved links whose `target_title` matches the new title
  or full path (same bucket, case-insensitive, ambiguity guard applies) —
  the "write the link first, it connects when the page appears" behavior.
  Already-resolved links are **sticky**: creating a second same-title
  document later does not retro-unresolve them.
- **Rename rewires, delete unresolves.** `kura mv` rewrites `[[old title]]`
  and `[[old/full/path]]` occurrences in referrers' bodies inside the same
  transaction (a path-only move rewrites just the full-path spelling — the
  rewrite matrix lives in
  [document-notation.md](document-notation.md#unresolved-links-and-rename-rewriting)).
  Deleting a document flips incoming links back to unresolved via the
  schema's `ON DELETE SET NULL` — the link text survives and re-resolves if
  the page is recreated. Moving a document to another bucket explicitly
  nulls its incoming links, because resolution is bucket-scoped.
- **Visibility.** `kura link broken` lists unresolved links grouped by
  target title; `kura status` reports the unresolved-link count; doctor's
  `resolve-links` fix handles bulk repair after imports or bucket surgery.

## Tag gardening

### `kura tag audit [--apply]` (`auditTags` in `src/core/gardening.ts`)

Pairwise scan of all tags, producing **merge candidates** and **oversized
tags**:

- Skip any ancestor/descendant pair (`tech` vs `tech/db` is hierarchy, not
  duplication).
- Flag a pair when the **normalized edit distance**
  (Levenshtein / max length) is **≤ 0.25** or it is a simple singular/plural
  variant (`+s` / `+es`).
- If an LLM provider is available, embed all tag paths once and additionally
  flag pairs (not already flagged) with **cosine similarity > 0.85** —
  catches semantic duplicates like `db` / `database` that edit distance
  misses. Without a provider, the CLI warns and audits with edit distance
  only.
- **Merge direction**: into the more-used tag; on a tie, into the shorter
  path. Candidates are de-duplicated per pair and sorted by similarity
  descending.
- **Oversized**: any tag attached to **> 30 %** of all documents is reported
  as a split candidate (it no longer discriminates).

`--apply` confirms each merge interactively (y/N on a TTY) and executes it
via `renameTag`, which moves descendant tags along and merges into an
existing target. Oversized tags are report-only — splitting is a human
decision.

### `kura tag suggest [--doc d | --untagged] [--apply]`

LLM tag suggestions (`suggestTagsForText` in `src/core/clip/format.ts`,
shared with `kura clip`). Requires a provider (exit code 4 otherwise).
Targets one document (`--doc`) or all untagged documents (`--untagged`,
via `untaggedDocuments`). The prompt includes the **existing tag list** and
strongly prefers reusing the current taxonomy over inventing new tags;
responses are cached in `llm_cache` (purpose `tag`). Without `--apply` it
only prints suggestions; with `--apply` each document's suggestions are
confirmed (TTY y/N; non-TTY applies without prompting) and written with
`source='auto'`, keeping LLM-assigned tags distinguishable from manual ones.

## Staleness detection

`src/core/stale.ts` scores documents older than `general.stale_days`
(default 180):

```
staleScore = (daysSinceUpdate / staleDays)
           / ((1 + ln(1 + accessCount)) × (1 + 0.5 × backlinks))
```

Age alone pushes the score up; being read (log-damped) or being linked to
(linear, factor 0.5 per backlink) pulls it down. A document is a staleness
candidate when the score is **≥ 1.0**; results are sorted descending so the
most neglected documents surface first. An untouched, unread, unlinked
document crosses 1.0 exactly at `stale_days`; a document with 10 reads or a
couple of backlinks stays below threshold for much longer
(see `tests/m6.test.ts`).

Surfaces:

- **`kura ls --stale`** — filters to score ≥ 1.0 and orders by score
  (`--limit` applies after scoring).
- **`kura status`** — stale count plus the top five with days / reads /
  score.
- **Browser UI** — the home page shows a 陳腐化候補 (staleness candidates)
  list and stat card; the graph view dims stale nodes;
  `GET /api/docs?stale=1` filters the list page.

Nothing is ever auto-deleted or archived: staleness exists to *prompt
review*.

## Deviations from SPEC

- **Embedding-model change is fixed, not just suggested.** SPEC §10.2 said
  doctor should "suggest recreating `chunks_vec`". `doctor --fix` performs
  the recreation (`vec-recreate`) and resets `embedded_at` itself; only the
  re-embedding (`kura embed`) is left to the user, since that needs a live
  provider and real time.
- **`tag suggest` targets untagged documents only.** SPEC §10.3 mentioned
  "untagged or *under-tagged*" documents; there is no under-tagged heuristic
  — the flag is `--untagged` (or an explicit `--doc`).
- **The browser/API use a cutoff, not the score.** `GET /api/docs?stale=1`,
  the graph's `stale` node flag, and the `staleDocuments` count in
  `collectStats` all use the simple `updated_at < now − stale_days` cutoff;
  only the CLI (`ls --stale`, `status` top-5) computes the full
  `staleScore`. The cutoff is a superset of score ≥ 1.0 candidates, cheap
  enough for per-request use — but the two notions of "stale" differ, which
  matters if you change either side.
