# Browser UI

> Covers SPEC §8.3. Key sources: `src/client/**`, `scripts/build-html.ts`,

The browser UI is a Preact SPA started with `kura browser`. It is a pure
client of the REST API — no server-side rendering, and no state beyond the
URL, `localStorage` (theme, selected bucket) and the one context built on it
(`bucket.tsx`). Everything is bundled into three fixed-name files
(`index.html` / `index.js` / `index.css`) so the compiled binary can embed
them with a static table.

## The selected bucket scopes everything

One bucket is selected at a time, picked in the sidebar and held in
`BucketProvider` (`bucket.tsx`, persisted as `localStorage["kura-bucket"]`).
Every screen — lists, search, the sidebar document and tag trees, the graph,
wiki-link resolution — passes that bucket to the API. **Nothing in the UI
searches or browses across buckets.** Two consequences worth knowing:

- Opening a document that lives in another bucket (direct URL, a wiki link)
  moves the selection to that document's bucket, so the sidebar always
  describes what is on screen (`DocDetail.tsx`).
- The selection resolves against the fetched bucket list: a stored name that
  no longer exists falls back to `main`, then to the first bucket. `Layout`
  holds the screens back until it resolves, so no list is ever rendered
  unscoped.

## File map

| Path (under `src/client/`) | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Static shell: `<div id="app">`, loads `/index.js` + `/index.css`, `lang="ja"` |
| `index.tsx` | Entry point: theme init, wouter route table, 404 |
| `api.ts` | Typed REST client; interfaces mirror `src/server/api.ts` responses (`DocMeta` / `SearchHit` include the document `path`); `resolveDocSpec()` wraps `GET /api/resolve`; `ApiError` carries the HTTP status |
| `bucket.tsx` | `BucketProvider` / `useBucket()` — the selected bucket every screen is scoped to; persisted in `localStorage["kura-bucket"]` |
| `lastdoc.ts` | Remembers the last-read document (`localStorage["kura-last-doc"]`) and rewrites `/` to it before the first render |
| `modal.tsx` | `ModalProvider` / `useModal()` — owns the three modals and the global shortcut handler |
| `shortcuts.ts` | The shortcut table (the list modal is generated from it) and the window `keydown` hook |
| `hooks.ts` | `useAsync()` — the single data-fetching primitive (loading/error/reload, stale-response guard); `useDocumentTitle()` sets `document.title` per screen |
| `markdown.ts` | Rendering pipeline: markdown-it + wikilink rule + highlight.js + DOMPurify; lazy mermaid loader |
| `format.ts` | Date/bytes/percent formatting, `escapeHtml`, `snippetHtml` (`**…**` → `<mark>`) |
| `theme.ts` | Light/dark theme: `data-theme` attribute + `localStorage` |
| `styles.css` | All styling; CSS custom properties per theme |
| `types.d.ts` | Ambient module declarations for the bundler |
| `components/Layout.tsx` | Header (search icon, nav, shortcut help) + sidebar (bucket picker, document tree, tag tree, theme toggle pinned at the bottom); refetches counts on navigation |
| `components/Modal.tsx` | Modal shell: overlay, Escape, focus in on open / restored on close; `ModalHints` renders the `<kbd>` footer |
| `components/SearchModal.tsx` | Raycast-style search: keystroke-by-keystroke keyword search, document / tag tabs, tag filter |
| `components/RecentModal.tsx` | Recently-viewed documents (Ctrl+R) |
| `components/ShortcutsModal.tsx` | The shortcut list (Ctrl+?), generated from `SHORTCUTS` |
| `components/DocContent.tsx` | Body rendering (markdown/html), mermaid activation, internal-link click delegation |
| `components/DocContextSidebar.tsx` | The open document's tags (add / remove) and its same-tag / same-path neighbours |
| `components/DocTree.tsx` | Collapsible per-bucket document-path tree; branches toggle, documents link to `/docs/<key>` |
| `currentdoc.tsx` | `CurrentDocProvider` — the detail screen publishes the document it fetched so the sidebar can show it without fetching again |
| `editor/` | The inline editor: `model.ts` (block model), `parse.ts` / `serialize.ts` (markdown ⇄ model), `dom.ts` (model ⇄ contenteditable, caret math), `Editor.tsx`, `blocks.tsx`, `Toolbar.tsx` |
| `components/TagTree.tsx` | Recursive tag hierarchy; links to `/docs?tag=` |
| `pages/Home.tsx` | Reading history (most recently viewed documents) |
| `pages/Stats.tsx` | Statistics + tidying insights (`GET /api/stats`, `GET /api/insights`) |
| `pages/DocList.tsx` | Filterable/paged document table |
| `pages/DocDetail.tsx` | Rendered document + related sidebar |
| `components/DocLink.tsx` | `DocTitle` (path prefix + title) and `DocLinkList` — the one place a list of document links is rendered |
| `pages/DocByTitle.tsx` | `[[link]]` resolution route (`GET /api/resolve` + search fallback) |
| `pages/Search.tsx` | 3-mode search |
| `pages/Tags.tsx` | Tag browser |
| `pages/Graph.tsx` | d3-force knowledge graph |

## Routing

`wouter-preact` `<Switch>` in `index.tsx`. Order matters: the more specific
`/docs/title/:title` and `/docs/:key/edit` are declared before `/docs/:key`.

| Path | Screen |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Home — reading history (redirects to the last-read document on a fresh visit) |
| `/docs` | Document list (filters live in the query string: `tag`, `prefix`, `sort`, `stale`, `page`) |
| `/docs/title/:title` | Wiki-link → key resolution (full path or title, wikilink fallback) |
| `/docs/:key/edit` | Gone — redirects to the document (reading and editing are the same screen) |
| `/docs/:key` | Document detail — read and edit in place |
| `/search` | Search (`q`, `mode`, `tag` in query string) |
| `/tags` | Tag browser |
| `/graph` | Knowledge graph |
| `/stats` | Statistics and tidying insights |
| anything else | 404 page |

The server serves `index.html` for unknown paths (SPA fallback,
[http-api.md](http-api.md)), so deep links work.

Filter/sort/paging state is kept **in the URL**, not component state, so
back/forward and copy-paste of links behave; changing a filter resets `page`.
The **bucket is the exception**: it is app-wide state, not a per-screen
filter, so it lives in the context above rather than in every query string.

Each screen sets `document.title` through `useDocumentTitle()` — the document
name on the detail page, the screen name elsewhere, both suffixed with
`— kura`.

## Screens

- **Home** — the reading history: the 50 most recently *viewed* documents in
  the selected bucket (`sort=accessed`, filtered to those with a
  `last_accessed_at`). It needs no new schema — `documents.last_accessed_at`
  is already bumped by `touchAccess()` on every read, including reads from the
  CLI and MCP, so the list reflects all of kura, not just the browser.
  - **Resume on open.** `bootRedirect()` (`lastdoc.ts`) rewrites `/` to
    `/docs/<last key>` *before the router reads the URL*, so a fresh visit
    lands back where the user left off. Only the bare `/` entry point
    redirects: the logo and the nav still reach the home screen, and a
    document that 404s (deleted) clears the memory so the next boot stops
    redirecting to it.
- **Statistics (`/stats`)** — stat cards from `/api/stats` (documents,
  buckets, tags, chunks, embedding coverage, stale candidates, unresolved
  links, DB size, tokenizer, embedding model), per-bucket document counts,
  and the **tidying insights** from `/api/insights` for the selected bucket:
  unfiled (bucket root), untagged, orphaned (no resolved link either way),
  broken wiki links, and duplicate-looking tags. Each card shows the count,
  names the CLI command that fixes it, and expands to the list. This screen
  never mutates anything — staleness and gardening surface review candidates;
  nothing is auto-deleted or auto-merged (see
  [self-healing.md](self-healing.md)).
- **Document list** — table with a hierarchical tag filter (descendants
  included, matching the API), document-path filter (`prefix`, also
  descendant-inclusive), sort selector, stale-only checkbox, 20 per page
  with prev/next pagination against `total`. Titles render with a muted
  `path/` prefix when the document has one. There is no bucket column or
  dropdown — the sidebar picker scopes the whole table.
- **Document detail** — reading and editing are the same screen (below). A path
  breadcrumb above the title (each segment links to `/docs?prefix=`); the title
  itself is editable in place; a save-status line and delete (confirm dialog);
  the **left** sidebar becomes the document's own (tags, same-tag and same-path
  neighbours), and the right one keeps metadata (bucket, access count,
  created/updated, source URL), **backlinks** and **two-hop links grouped by the
  shared target** from `/api/docs/:key/related`.
- **Search page (`/search`)** — mode toggle (キーワード / ベクトル /
  ハイブリッド) and a tag filter, `limit=30`, always within the selected
  bucket. Renders API `warnings` (degraded mode) above results; each hit
  shows title, source badge, score, snippet with `<mark>` highlights, and tag
  chips. This is the *full* search; the modal below is the fast path.
- **Sidebar document tree** — a sidebar section rendering
  `GET /api/docs/tree` for the selected bucket. Built by
  `buildDocTree` in core (mirrors `buildTagTree`): branch nodes come from
  path prefixes and toggle open/closed (component state, default closed);
  document nodes link to the detail page; a branch whose path is itself a
  document does both. Titles containing a literal `/` stay single leaves.
- **Tag browser** — the selected bucket's tag tree with "direct / total
  including descendants" counts; every node links to the filtered document
  list. Tags no document in the bucket uses do not appear.
- **Knowledge graph** — see below.
- **Link resolution (`/docs/title/:title`)** — calls `GET /api/resolve`
  (`resolveDocSpec()` in `api.ts`) with the raw link text — full path or
  unique title, the same `resolveDoc` grammar as the CLI — and redirects to
  the detail page on success (`replace: true` so history stays clean). A 404
  (not created yet) or 409 (ambiguous) falls back to a keyword search and
  shows an "unresolved link" page listing the closest matches with their
  full paths — the click-through target for red wikilinks.

## Modals and keyboard shortcuts

`ModalProvider` (`modal.tsx`) sits inside the router, owns which modal is open
and hosts the single window `keydown` listener (`useShortcuts`). The header's
magnifier icon opens the same search modal the shortcut does.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl + P` | Search modal |
| `Ctrl + N` | New untitled document (created in the selected bucket, then opened) |
| `Ctrl + ?` | Shortcut list |
| `Ctrl + R` | Recently viewed documents |
| `Ctrl + H` | Home |
| `Ctrl + T` | Tag browser |
| `Escape` | Close the modal |
| `↑` `↓` `Enter` | Move / choose inside a modal |

**Why Ctrl and not Cmd.** On macOS the browser and the OS own Cmd+T (new
tab), Cmd+H (hide app), Cmd+R (reload), Cmd+N (new window) and Cmd+P (print);
a page cannot take them back, and stealing Cmd+R would cost the user reload.
Ctrl+letter is effectively free there. On Windows / Linux the browser owns
Ctrl+T, Ctrl+N and Ctrl+P — a known limitation, stated in the shortcut list
rather than worked around; where the page does receive the key, kura's action
takes precedence over the browser's.

**New document (`Ctrl + N`).** `POST /api/docs` creates 無題 at the root of the
selected bucket and the UI opens it with the placeholder title selected, so the
first thing typed replaces it. A colliding title retries as 無題 (2) server-side
(`createDocumentWithRetry`), so pressing Ctrl+N twice never fails.

Two rules keep the handler out of the user's way, and both matter for
Japanese input:

- **Composition is never a shortcut.** `e.isComposing` (and `keyCode === 229`)
  short-circuits the handler, so keystrokes that belong to an IME conversion
  cannot fire an action — including `Enter`, which confirms a conversion.
- **Typing wins.** With focus in an input, textarea, select or contenteditable,
  every shortcut except `Escape` is ignored.

The **search modal** is the fast path: keyword mode only, scoped to the
selected bucket, with the query debounced 150 ms and re-issued against
`/api/search` on every keystroke. It reuses the server pipeline deliberately —
the vaporetto morphological tokenizer, BM25 ranking and `**…**` snippets have
no client-side equivalent, and the API is on localhost, so a round trip reads
as instant. (A client-side index — DuckDB-WASM and friends — was considered
and rejected: tens of MB in a binary that must stay self-contained
[`scope.md` R6], and no way to reproduce Japanese tokenization.) Two tabs:
documents, and tags — the tag list is small, so it is fetched once per bucket
and filtered in the browser. Choosing a tag sets it as the document filter
rather than navigating away. Vector and hybrid search stay on `/search`.

## The inline editor (`src/client/editor/`)

There is no separate editor screen: a Markdown document is rendered as editable
blocks, and typing into one is the edit. `PUT /api/docs/:key` is issued 1.5 s
after the last change (Ctrl+S saves at once); the status is shown next to the
title, and a dirty document warns on unload.

```
markdown ──parse.ts──► Block[] ──dom.ts──► contenteditable DOM
   ▲                      │                        │
   └───serialize.ts───────┘◄────dom.ts (read)──────┘
```

**The model is the source of truth; Markdown is what it serializes to.** A save
is `serializeMarkdown(blocks)`. `tests/editor.test.ts` pins the round trip on
Japanese fixtures: `parse → serialize` must be a fixed point, or an edit would
silently rewrite parts of the document the user never touched.

Load-bearing decisions, each of which was a bug first:

- **One contenteditable per block, and every block is a `<div>`.** Not one big
  editable region (the browser invents and destroys structure in those), and not
  a `<p>`/`<h2>`/`<li>` per block type: changing a paragraph into a heading or a
  list item must not swap the DOM node, because a swap blurs the element and the
  keystrokes that arrive before focus is restored are simply lost. The heading
  look, the quote bar and the list bullet are all CSS on one `div` (the bullet is
  a `::before` from `data-marker`, so it cannot be deleted as text).
- **The DOM is re-rendered only when the model moved behind its back** (undo,
  toolbar, autoformat, structural edits — signalled by a `nonce`). Typing does
  *not* re-render: the DOM is already right and the model follows it. Re-rendering
  on every keystroke rebuilds the text nodes under the caret and drops characters.
- **IME safety.** `compositionstart` suspends model sync entirely and
  `compositionend` resumes it; every key handler ignores `isComposing`
  (and `keyCode === 229`). Enter during a conversion confirms it — it must not
  split the block.
- **A trailing space in a contenteditable arrives as U+00A0**, so the autoformat
  prefixes (`# `, `- `, `1. `, `> `, ```` ``` ````) normalize it before matching.
- **Inline marks go through `execCommand`** (bold / italic / strike / link): the
  browser edits the DOM and keeps the caret, then the model is re-read from the
  DOM. `<b>`/`<i>` are mapped back to `strong`/`em` when reading.
- **Nothing reaches the DOM as HTML.** `dom.ts` builds nodes one by one and reads
  them back by walking; a pasted `<script>` can never become live markup. Pasted
  `text/html` goes through turndown → `parse.ts` → blocks.
- **Lists are flat in the model** (`{inline, depth, ordered}` per item). Nesting is
  a rendering and serialization concern; a flat list is what makes Enter, Backspace
  and Tab tractable, and a bullet list with an ordered list nested inside still
  round-trips.
- **Code, tables and raw HTML are edited as text** and shown as a rendered preview
  otherwise (with a pencil to switch). A WYSIWYG table editor is not worth
  building, and the preview is what keeps mermaid and highlighted code readable
  now that this screen is also the reader.
- **`content_type: "html"` documents (clips) stay read-only** — their markup is
  not ours to restructure.

Undo is a stack of model snapshots (typing coalesced at 500 ms, structural edits
pushed immediately), so Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z never fight the browser's own
history.

Known limits: selection cannot span two blocks (each is its own editable), and
`[[wikilinks]]` are edited as their own source text rather than as chips.

## Rendering pipeline

Implemented in `src/client/markdown.ts` and applied by
`components/DocContent.tsx`.

```
markdown-it (html: true, linkify) 
  → wikilink inline rule ([[Title]] / resolution via env)
  → highlight.js (curated language set, fenced code)
  → DOMPurify.sanitize()          ← always the final step
  → dangerouslySetInnerHTML
  → mermaid blocks upgraded lazily in the DOM
```

- **markdown-it** is configured with `html: true` (raw HTML allowed *because*
  DOMPurify runs afterwards) and `linkify: true`; GFM tables are on by
  default. Fenced code is highlighted with a hand-picked highlight.js
  language set (registering `highlight.js/lib/core` + individual languages
  keeps the bundle small). `mermaid` fences are deliberately *not*
  highlighted so they stay findable as `code.language-mermaid`.
- **Wikilinks**: an inline rule registered before `link` parses `[[Title]]`
  (rejecting empty titles, newlines, and nested `[`). The renderer consults
  `env.resolve` (a `WikiResolver`): resolved titles become
  `<a class="wikilink" href="/docs/<key>">`, unresolved ones become
  `<a class="wikilink wikilink-unresolved" href="/docs/title/<title>">`
  (rendered red) pointing at the resolution route above. `DocDetail` builds
  the resolver from the already-fetched related outlinks, so no extra
  request is needed. The `[[Title|display text]]` form from SPEC §4 is not
  rendered specially (see Deviations).
- **Sanitization invariant**: every string that reaches
  `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` **must pass through DOMPurify** —
  `renderMarkdown()` sanitizes its own output, `sanitizeHtml()` covers
  `content_type = "html"` documents, and search snippets go through
  `snippetHtml()` (escape first, then insert `<mark>` only). Never
  interpolate server data into HTML by any other route.
- **Mermaid**: `DocContent` watches `code.language-mermaid` blocks with an
  `IntersectionObserver` and upgrades each block only when it scrolls into
  view. `loadMermaid()` imports `mermaid@11` from the jsdelivr CDN — the
  dynamic import goes through `new Function("u", "return import(u)")` so
  Bun's bundler does not try to resolve the URL. This CDN fetch is **the
  only external network resource in the entire UI** (and it is initiated by
  the user's own browser, on demand); everything else is bundled. On load
  failure or diagram syntax errors the plain code block is kept — no error
  UI, no retry loop. Mermaid runs with `securityLevel: "strict"` and picks
  its theme from the kura theme at first load.
- **Internal navigation**: rendered HTML is inert, so `DocContent` delegates
  clicks — a left-click on an `<a href="/...">` without modifier keys is
  intercepted and routed through wouter instead of a full page load.

## Theming

`theme.ts` stamps `data-theme="light" | "dark"` on `<html>`:

1. `initTheme()` (run before first render) prefers `localStorage["kura-theme"]`,
   falling back to `prefers-color-scheme`.
2. The toggle — an icon-only button (`lucide-preact` Sun / Moon) pinned to the
   bottom of the sidebar — calls `setTheme()`, which persists the choice.
3. All colors are CSS custom properties on `:root` /
   `:root[data-theme="dark"]` in `styles.css`; a
   `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block targeting
   `:root:not([data-theme])` covers the instant before JS runs (and no-JS).
   highlight.js token colors are custom properties too, so both themes share
   one stylesheet.

### Brand color

kura's accent is **Hanada (縹 / Japan Blue)** — an indigo drawn from the
world of the Edo-period white-plastered storehouse (蔵) the name evokes. It
deepens to a saturated blue on the light "plaster" ground and lightens on the
dark "sumi (墨)" ground so it stays legible on both.

| Token | Light (`#`) | Dark (`#`) | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| accent | `#275c86` | `#64abda` | primary accent — buttons, links, active nav, the wordmark |
| accent-text | `#ffffff` | `#10131a` | text/foreground placed **on** the accent |

The same brand hue is applied across every kura surface, each defining it in
its own token vocabulary:

| Surface | File | Light accent | Dark accent |
|---|---|---|---|
| Browser UI | `src/client/styles.css` (`--accent` / `--accent-text`) | `#275c86` | `#64abda` |
| Docs site | `docs/src/styles/custom.css` (`--sl-color-accent`; `-low` / `-high` shades) | `#275c86` (low `#d8e8f4`, high `#1d465f`) | `#64abda` (low `#123246`, high `#a8d3ec`) |
| Favicons | `docs/public/favicon.svg` | block `#275c86`, lattice `#cfe6f5` | — |
| Marp deck | `docs/marp/kura-v0.1.ja.md` | `#275c86` (headings, accents) | — |

When retheming, change the accent in each surface's own token block — there is
no shared source file across surfaces, so the four files above are the canonical
list to keep in sync.

## Knowledge graph implementation

`pages/Graph.tsx` uses **only `d3-force`** (no d3-selection/zoom/drag —
keeping the dependency surface small) and renders plain SVG DOM:

- Nodes/edges come from `/api/graph` (optionally bucket-filtered). The
  "孤立ノードを表示" checkbox includes/excludes `degree === 0` nodes; edges are
  re-filtered so both endpoints exist.
- **Color = top-level segment of the node's first tag**, palette assigned in
  descending frequency order; untagged nodes are gray. A legend is rendered
  from the same assignment.
- Node radius grows with `degree` (`4 + √degree × 2.5`); labels render for
  every node on small graphs (≤ 120 nodes), otherwise only for `degree ≥ 2`;
  every node gets a `<title>` tooltip.
- **Stale nodes are dimmed** via the `stale` class (opacity in CSS), matching
  the staleness surfaced on Home.
- Zoom (wheel, 0.2×–5×, cursor-anchored), pan (background drag), and node
  drag (fixing `fx`/`fy` while dragging, with `alphaTarget` reheat) are
  **hand-rolled pointer-event handlers** on the SVG — hit-testing finds the
  nearest node within its radius. A click that never moved more than 3 px
  navigates to the document detail.
- `setupGraph()` returns a cleanup function (stop simulation, remove
  listeners, clear the SVG); the effect re-runs on data/toggle changes.

Two-hop links are *not* drawn in the graph (direct links only); that is
explicit future work ([roadmap.md](roadmap.md)).

## Build pipeline

`bun run build:client` → `scripts/build-html.ts`:

1. `Bun.build` bundles `src/client/index.tsx` (target `browser`, minified,
   no sourcemaps) into `dist/` with **fixed, hash-free names**
   (`naming: "[dir]/[name].[ext]"`).
2. The CSS artifact is normalized to `dist/index.css` (renamed if Bun emitted
   another name; copied straight from `styles.css` if Bun emitted none).
3. `index.html` is copied verbatim, and the script fails loudly if any of the
   three artifacts is missing.

Hash-free names matter because `scripts/compile.ts` embeds `dist/*` into the
single binary by generating `src/generated/embedded.ts` (URL path → embedded
file path, via `with { type: "file" }` imports) and the server's embedded
resolver looks paths up verbatim. In development the generated module stays a
stub (empty table) and assets are served from `dist/`; `compile.ts` restores
the stub after building. Details in
[build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md); serving order in
[http-api.md](http-api.md).

`tests/client-build.test.ts` guards the pipeline: it runs the real build,
then serves `dist/` through `startServer` and asserts content types and the
SPA fallback.

## UI language policy

**All user-visible strings in `src/client/` are intentionally Japanese** —
kura is a Japanese-first knowledge tool, and the browser UI is one of the two
sanctioned Japanese surfaces (the other being LLM prompt templates); see
`CLAUDE.md`. Do not "fix" UI strings into English. Code comments,
identifiers, and CSS class names stay English.

## Deviations from SPEC

- **The `/docs/title/:title` route and `GET /api/resolve` are additions.**
  SPEC §8.3 only asks for `[[リンク]]` to become clickable; the
  implementation resolves link text server-side via `resolveDoc` (full path
  / unique title — [http-api.md](http-api.md)) and gives unresolved or
  ambiguous links a landing page with near-match suggestions.
- **`[[Title|display text]]` is not special-cased** in the renderer: the raw
  inner text (including the `|display`) is used as both label and lookup key,
  whereas SPEC §4 defines the pipe form. Core extraction handles it; the
  browser renderer currently does not split it.
- **There is no separate editor and no `<textarea>`.** SPEC §8.3 asks for a
  plain textarea editor on its own route; the UI edits the rendered document in
  place (block-level contenteditable, autosaved), and `/docs/:key/edit`
  redirects to the document. Title and tags are edited on the same screen — the
  title inline, the tags in the sidebar — both riding the existing PUT contract.
  Code, tables and raw HTML keep a text editing surface, and clipped
  `content_type: "html"` documents stay read-only.
- **Graph node coloring** is by *top-level segment of the first tag* with a
  frequency-ordered palette; SPEC just says "colored by tag".
- **Mermaid via CDN** matches SPEC §8.3 ("Mermaid lazy-loaded") but note it
  is the product's only runtime external resource beyond the sanctioned list
  in `CLAUDE.md`; it is browser-initiated, lazy, and fails closed to a plain
  code block.
- **The selected bucket is app-wide state, not a per-screen filter.** SPEC
  §8.3 sketches a bucket dropdown on the list and search screens; the UI
  instead picks one bucket in the sidebar, persists it, and scopes every
  screen to it. Cross-bucket browsing and search were dropped deliberately:
  a bucket is a workspace, and results that straddle two of them were noise.
  This is also the single exception to "no state outside the URL".
